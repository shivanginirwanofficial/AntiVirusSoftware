#**AntiVirusSoftware**
##**Abstract:**
So testing a computer virus detection program in other words, Testing a Antivirus and/or security software. In 1971, Bob Thomas, computer scientist, created an experimental program called The Creeper which ran the TENEX operating system and used the ARPANET network. Ray Tomlinson, computer scientist, created not only the newer version of The Creeper but also The Reaper. The Reaper uses ARPANET and removed the copied The Creeper program. The Creeper and The Reaper are the first virus and antivirus ever. In 1987, there was a virus called Vienna Virus and Bernd Fix, german security expert, defeated it. The significance is that if your system has a virus, your files are gone. The proposed research objective is How do we test antivirus and/or security software? There must be a antivirus and/or security software without causing the computer to have a virus or the computer should have a virus.

##**1. Background and Significance:** 
Significance: The objective is to test antivirus software on an old computer and see the results. Computer Virus is a bad thing and so is the cost…time. The more time spent locating, isolating, identifying and then destroying viruses, learning about viruses and cures, educating etc., the more damage the virus will do [5]. Time is significant because as you are spending time figuring out about the virus etc., a virus is making its way to destroy everything, which is more unwanted, wasted time and money too. Educating people while a virus is happening…cool?! 
People love to ignore and/or bypass security warnings because compliance gets affected [6]. Security warnings are significant because…not listening to warnings causes chaos and a virus will enter and you will get blamed because warnings were there ahead of time and you ignored it. 

##**Background:** 
Computer Virus is a code that pretty much copies to other programs and destroys the program. Viruses secretly cause chaos and then when it is a big deal, they make their presence known [1]. Virus pretty much works by altering harmless programs to harmful programs [8]. Those harmful programs look to other programs and infect by modifying the files to include a copy of the virus code and inserting an instruction to branch to that code at the old program’s starting point. Then the virus starts up the original program so that the user is unaware of its intervention. In other words, the virus changes from harmless programs to harmful programs. The virus goes into the file and makes it infected, which by having a copy of virus code would help, thanks for making that, now you can send an instruction to get the very first code at the very first program’s first lines of code. 
Virus is also accessed by a user opening up a work processor text file aka user opening up an email [7]. There are many types of programs like viruses like Trojan Horse (a very dangerous bug that your files are 100% gone). Virus has many names, logic bombs, time bombs etc. 
Now a quick thing on detection, viruses are sneaky sneaky because they avoid it by hiding in binary then source code…nice try backing up your system because a virus is chilling by the beach with shades…  

##**Related Work:** 
The number of bytes that the virus has impacts programs. The bytes from primary memory to processor transferred plays a significant role for the effectiveness of the program [3]. Don’t you think a virus can just copy that? Yes it can. Viruses can pretty much change the bytes to infected bytes. Enhanced algorithms are better than unenhanced algorithms. Enhanced algorithms means algorithms with significant improvement. For example, OD-tests, enhanced algorithms had more impact than unenhanced which is a good thing [2]. If the algorithm isn’t strong enough, then a virus can change those numbers.
The more complicated a computer system is, the system will get a negative effect. For example, if you were in the military, the complex computers are that complex that mistrust developed among the military [4] I mean you could just destroy the copies of code right…I mean that’s the problem when no one paid attention to the warning signs. Also the systems were weak which the virus took advantage of.  
To detect malicious files, an efficient method is ensemble classifiers.  “Random forest is a very successful ensemble classifier based on bootstrap aggregation algorithm and decision tree. The research [4–9] proves that random forest can achieve the best result compared to other classifiers. This experiment sets the number of trees in the forest to 100 and the number of features to be considered for best splitting to 50 percent.” In other words, out of all the ensemble classifiers, random forest is successful for detecting malicious files.
